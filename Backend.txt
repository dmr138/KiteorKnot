My role is backend, and I am currently looking into which frameworks we could use for
the backend, such as Django or NodeJS depending on what languages our group is more
comforable with. We will be using SQL for our databases, but I am not yet certain if 
we will be using PostgreSQL, MySQL, or some other alternative. Additionally, as our
group is largely inexperienced with creating full stack projects, I am hoping that
I can also develop skills surrounding the use of developing a front end interface.
