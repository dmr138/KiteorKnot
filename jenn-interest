I'm interested in focusing on backend development due to my experience with SQL and infrastructure-as-code.
I feel that this makes sense due to my (admittedly limited) experience with Terraform, AWS, Docker, etc.
Because it makes sense to create documentation and some testing for the backend during the creation process, I wouldalso like to play a role in documentation.
However, if other people want to focus on backend development, I'm also happy to sink my teeth into learning more about Javascript, React, and frontend work.
