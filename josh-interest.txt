My role is backend, but we have not yet decided on which framework we will be using, such as Django or NodeJS, depending on the language
the group is most comfortable with. As far as databases go, we have settled on using SQL, but have not decided if it will be MySQL,
PostgreSQL, or some other variant. As most of our group is largely inexperienced with creating full stack projects, I am still hoping
that I will still gain some experience in developing a user interface.
